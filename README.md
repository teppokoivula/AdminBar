## Installing the module

This module can be installed just like any other ProcessWire module: copy or clone the directory
containing this module to your /site/modules/ directory, log in, go to Admin > Modules, click
"Check for new modules", and install "AdminBar".

Alternatively you can use the module installer in ProcessWire's Admin or Composer to install this
module. The module is available via Packagist for Composer installation as `teppokoivula/admin-bar`.

### Requirements

- ProcessWire >= 3.0.112
- PHP >= 7.1.0

If you're running an earlier version of ProcessWire or PHP, you can use the 1.1.5 release of this
module instead. Note, though, that 1.x branch of the module is no longer supported, and as such it
*may not* work as expected, and *will* lack some of the features available via the 2.x branch.

## Permissions

By default AdminBar is visible only for superusers only. If you want to grant non-superusers access
to AdminBar, please add permission "adminbar" to their role(s).

If you are upgrading from an older version of AdminBar, you may need to uninstall and then reinstall
the module in order to see that permission. Alternatively you can add this permission manually: just
provide "adminbar" as the name of the permission (the label doesn't really matter).

## Themes

AdminBar comes with a selection of built-in themes. You can change the theme via module config, and
if you want you can also create a custom theme of your own:

1. Create directory for your custom theme anywhere under your site directory. This directory should
   contain at least theme.css file, but you can also include theme.js, theme.php, and config.php.

   *For examples on how theme files work, check out the uikit theme, found from the /themes/uikit/
   directory within the AdminBar directory.*

2. Select "Custom ..." option for theme in module config.
3. Type into the "Custom theme" text input the path to the directory your custom theme's files are
   located in. This path should be relative to (start from) your site directory.

## Hooks

As with any ProcessWire module, you can identify hookable methods by the three underscores before
the method name: `___hookableMethod()`. Here are the details for most common hookable methods in
the AdminBar module/class:

* `___isEnabled()`: this method returns a boolean that defines if AdminBar should be enabled (i.e.
  displayed) for current request.
* `___isEnabledFor(Page $page)`: this method returns a boolean that defines if AdminBar should be
  enabled for provided page.
* `___render()`: this method renders the Admin Bar. You can hook _before_ it if you want to provide
  custom arguments for the method (overriding strings etc.) or you can hook _after_ it if you want
  to manually modify the returned output string.
* `___getTemplates()`: this method returns the "template strings" used by the render method. These
  are essentially the parts that make up the final markup, and if you want to modify the markup of
  the Admin Bar, you can hook _after_ this method and modify the returned template strings array.
* `___getData()`: this method returns the value of the data-adminbar attribute added to the Admin
  Bar. If you need custom properties mainly for JavaScript use, you should hook _after_ this method
  and modify the returned array of options.
* `___getItems()`: this method returns a list of items displayed in the Admin Bar. You can modify
  certain aspects of these items (strings/labels, use of modal links, etc.) by hooking _before_ this
  method and modifying the args array â€“ or if you want to modify the displayed items, you can hook
  _after_ this method and modify the returned array of items.

## Frontend utilities

You can use the `data-adminbar-adjust` attribute to control behaviour of frontend elements while
Admin Bar is enabled/displayed. This attribute should contain a space-separated list of CSS
properties that should be modified when Admin Bar height is recalculated.

Example and supported values:

```
<div data-adminbar-adjust="top max-height"></div>
```

Adjustments are applied as inline CSS styles. Assuming that the height of the Admin Bar was 100px
at the time of calculation, the example above would result in...

```
<div style="top: 100px; max-height: calc(100% - 100px);" data-adminbar-adjust="top max-height"></div>
```
